If you want to run either the Release or Debug Version of the project, you need to change the file extensions of the PegPuzzleSolver.herp in the
Release or Debug Folder to .exe in order for it to run.  You can also rebuild the game in Visual Studio 2013 if you have it to make a 
new .exe file as well.
